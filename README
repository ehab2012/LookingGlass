The following instructions details how to install LG using ansible. It is assumed that the remote host is new fresh mrvm.net nat vps created with a minimal debian 10 template.

Through-out the next sections the remote vps will be called mvm and controller "local" is a linux shell based terminal. It is required to install ansible on local terminal.

It is out of scope of this document to explain how to install ansible but can easily be done using the local distribution resouces.

for example installing documenation can be found here https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html and some google result on debian 11 https://idroot.us/install-ansible-debian-11/


Section 1 - general vps setup
==============================
the main target is to upgrade and prepare the vps for provisioning later with ansible.

    on remote as root upgrade, reboot and install sudo, python3:
    ------------------------------------------------------------
      # apt-get --allow-releaseinfo-change update
      # apt-get upgrade
      # nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config   # after copying the pub key change yes to prohibit-password
            .....
            PermitRootLogin yes  #  prohibit-password

      # reboot
          # login again 
      # apt-get install sudo python3


    on local its best to add all the lg vps into the ssh config file and add pub key:
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      $ nano .ssh/config
                .....
                Host mvm
                  HostName 213.246.58.161
                  port 14221

      $ ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_dsa.pub root@mvm


Section 2 - configuring inventory, variables and inital testing
================================================================
There are some yaml files that describe remotes and variables. It is advised to check and update these values where necessary.

  hosts.yaml :
      This is the main inventory file
